uploading to github:
```
Step 1. navigate to the project folder. cd into it.open it in vscode using code .

Step 2. open terminal and type: git init
Note:This will initialize a git repository

Step 3. then type: git add .
Note: this will tell git to start tracking all the files in the folder

Step 4. then we will type: git commit -m "your-message -here"
Note: This will take a snapshot of the code and save it to the local git repository

Step 5. Go over to Github and create a new repository.
Note:do not add README and keep the folder public.

Step 6. copy the commands under push an EXISTING repository from the command line section and paste them in your terminal and press enter.
Note:the first commands establishes the connection between local git repository and your remote github repository.
The second command renames the branch from master to main.
The third command pushes your file to github and uses the -u flag which sets the upstream so that the next time you have to push you don't have to specify origin or branch.

Step 7. Congratulations! your first commit was uploaded to github successfully.

Step 8. if you make any changes to your file going forward all you have to do is repeat:
git add .
git commit -m"your message"
git push
and your code will be pushed to github
```
