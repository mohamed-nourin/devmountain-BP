// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//Answer: 
// 1- Analysis of Requirements 
// 2- Planning
// 3- Design
// 4- Implementation
// 5- Testing & Integration
// 6- Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirments = "This is the very first step in the sdlc, in which the requierments are looked at first. It is very important because we always work according to the bussniess requirments."
const planning = "This is the second step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the software is being designed, structured, and defined. This step also includes creating detailed technical specifications, user interface designs, and database designs."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which  software system is developed, tested, and deployed. It involves transforming the design specifications and requirements into actual working software.  the development team writes code, creates software components, integrates modules, and performs unit testing to ensure the individual pieces of the software are functioning correctly.  "
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which we do testing dedicated to verifying and validating the software system. It includes various testing activities such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. The goals of this step is to make sure that the software meets the specified requirements in the fisrt step, and that the software functions correctly."
const maintain = "This is the sixth and last step, in which the software is being maintained.This phase involves the ongoing support and enhancement of the software. It includes activities like bug fixing, updates, performance optimization, and addressing user feedback. This step ensures the software remains reliable, secure, and up-to-date."
